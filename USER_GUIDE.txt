====================
SNAPEEK USER GUIDE
====================

This project allows you to upload, view, and manage screenshots/images both online (with internet) and offline (from your local machine).

--------------------
FEATURES
--------------------
1. Online Dashboard
   - View all your images stored in the cloud (MongoDB/Cloudinary).
   - Organized by categories/folders.
   - Login/logout functionality.
   - AI-generated descriptions for images.

2. Offline Gallery
   - View all images that have been downloaded to your local machine.
   - Organized by categories/folders.
   - Works without internet (as long as the backend server is running).

3. Auto-Download
   - On server start, all images from the cloud are downloaded and organized into folders in `/src/public/images/<category>/`.
   - You can also trigger a manual download by visiting `http://localhost:5000/images/download-all`.

4. Online/Offline Detection
   - The app detects your internet connection status.
   - If you go offline, you are redirected to the offline gallery.
   - If you are online, you can use the dashboard and all features.

--------------------
HOW TO USE
--------------------
1. Start the backend server:
   - Open a terminal in the `snapeekBackend` folder.
   - Run: `npm start` or `node server.js`
   - The server will connect to MongoDB and download all images for offline use.

2. Start the frontend:
   - Open a terminal in `snapeekBackend/userside_snapeek_frontend`.
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Login and Use the Dashboard:
   - Login with your credentials.
   - View, search, and manage your images online.
   - Use the sidebar to filter by category.
   - Use the "Offline" link in the navbar to view local images.

4. Offline Usage:
   - As long as the backend server is running, you can view downloaded images in the offline gallery, even without internet.
   - If you stop the backend server, offline images will NOT be available.

--------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES
--------------------
- You must keep the backend server running to access offline images.
- Login and online features require an internet connection (for MongoDB Atlas).
- Images are organized in `/src/public/images/<category>/` for offline use.
- The app will automatically redirect you to the offline gallery if you lose internet connection.
- To refresh images, use the refresh button in the UI or reload the page.

--------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------
- If you see "Failed to load categories" or "No images found" in offline mode, make sure the backend server is running and images are downloaded.
- If you cannot login, check your internet connection and MongoDB Atlas credentials.
- For any server errors, check the terminal logs in the backend folder.

--------------------
FOR DEVELOPERS
--------------------
- Backend code is in `snapeekBackend/`.
- Frontend code is in `snapeekBackend/userside_snapeek_frontend/`.
- Image download logic: `src/utils/downloadAllCloudinaryImages.js`
- Local image API endpoints: `src/routes/images.js` (`/images/local-categories`, `/images/local-list/:category`)
- To add new features, edit the respective files in the backend or frontend folders.
